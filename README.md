## Part I: Choosing to Choose

### 1. The Limit Embracing Life

* Previously humanity was a task-based society; currently it is time-based society (get more done in less time)
* We don't have time for everything in our short lives

### 2. The Efficiency Trap

* The faster we do more, the more quickly we make room for more do to
* A pitfall of convenience is we continually expect more from the time we saved

### 3. Facing Finitude

* What does it mean for a human being to *be*?
  * we each have a lifetime (which lasts only for a small amount of time)
* Making positive commitments of time can create "joy of missing out" when saying "no" to alternatives (rather than "fear of missing out")
