## Part I: Choosing to Choose

### 1. The Limit Embracing Life

* Previously humanity was a task-based society; currently it is time-based society (get more done is less time)
* We don't have time for everything in our short lives

### 2. The Efficiency Trap

* The faster we do more, the more quickly we make room for more do to
* A pitfall of convenience is we continually expect more from the time we saved
